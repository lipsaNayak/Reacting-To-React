# Reacting-To-React
Sample scripts explaining React in quick and easy way

The github repo for React can be very demanding for someone new to it.
This repo contains small sample files which have example to make one understand React basics in a very short time. 
The file names are self explainatory.

To get handes on:
1. Download the code.
2. Run npm install.
3. The main file is main.js. 
   It has a line " import App from './App';". For working for different examples just change the file_name accordingly.
   Like for eg: "import App from ./App_this.props.children.js", will load the App component written in the file App_this.props.children.js
   rather than App component written in the file App.js.
4. Run npm start.
